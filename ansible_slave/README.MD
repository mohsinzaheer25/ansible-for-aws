# Ansible Slave

Ansible Slave is to setup EC2 instance in order to get maintain by Ansible.

## How it works?

It is using Terraform which is a **infrastructure as a code** tool to provision resources on AWS then uses Playbook to setup it.

## Things Need To Know

Your machine from where you running this project need to install below things.

1. Terraform
2. Ansible

You need to create `IAM User` with Access Key and Secret with permission that can create resources on AWS. You can use same credentials used for Ansible Master if you want to. Also, you need to create a `SSH KEY` on AWS which you will be using to login into the server.

`ansibleadmin` user will be created and added to Sudoers file in order to have root access.

## Variables

Terrform has different variables and its values can be change in [Terraform Vars](terraform.tfvars) according to your need.

| Variable Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| access_key | Access Key ID of IAM User
| secret_key | Secret Key of IAM User
| name | Name of the instance
| type | Type i.e. Master 
| environment | Enviroment of the instance. i.e. Dev, QA or Prod
| user | User to login to the created instance
| private_key_path | Path for Private Ke

## Provisioning Ansible Master

First, you need to replace the necessary variables in [Terraform Vars](terraform.tfvars) and then initiate terraform by using below command in order to get the appropriated plugin.

```
terraform init
```

You can check the changes Terraform is making using below command

```
terraform plan
```

Once everything looks good, you can provision the resource using below command

```
terraform apply
```
