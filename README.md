# Ansible For AWS

This project is to setup Ansible and manage AWS resources using Ansible. We are using Master and Slave concept for better understanding between Ansible and different resources.

## Ansible Master

This project is using Master terminology to give a feeling that this server will be running Ansible and maintaining resources using a dynamic inventory. Ansible Master folder has it's own README for more details.

## Ansible Slave

Ansible Slave folder is created to give an example how a EC2 instance can be created, setup and integrated with Ansible Master in automated fashion. There is no correct or bad way of doing it but this is one way to automated creating resources. Ansible Slave folder has it's own README for more details.
